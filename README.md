# AI-WumpusWorld
Desktop app 

# Code organisation
The solution was develpped in Visual Studio. It is organised in 3 projects
* CustomControls -
This project contains visual elements for the World.
* WumpusWorld -
Contains the game logic, handles user input. Monitors performance of the player over single and multiple games (gives points for winning, and takes them for moves).
* Agent -
Contains AI logic. The agent calculates the probability of a tile being safe. It maximises its overall performance.

A built executable (for Windows) can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_qM-y0dRpjMakdsLUtMMUJDcTg).

The code is overall not in good shape. If you would like to see some code in good shape have a look at my AI-TickTackToe project.
